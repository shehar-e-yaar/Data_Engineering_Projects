## 🚀 What This Repository Contains

### ✅ **1. ETL Pipelines**
Real-world **Extract → Transform → Load** pipelines built using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL.

Included Projects:
- `etl_city_pipeline/` → City data ETL + cleaning + loading + reporting  
- `etl_student_pipeline/` → Students ETL + SQL joins + grade classification + reporting  

More ETL pipelines will be added as I progress.
